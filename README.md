# Khatami_Node.js

### Introduction

Node js is an environment to run java script outside of the browser .<br>

Node.js was created in 2009 and built on chrome v8 javascript emgine <br>

Every browser has an engine a toll that compiles our code <br>

down to machine code and chrome uses one by the name of v8 <br>

In extremely simple terms the creator of node Ryan dahl <br>
 ripped the v8 engine and build node on top of it <br>

 Since the moment it was created the node has evoved tremendously <br>

 and where there are many things to like about node <br>

 I particularly enjoy large community around node sinec that tremendously save3s time <br>

 on feature development as well as the fact withe help of node it is never been easier <br>

 to build full stack apps since both front end and bacxk end are essentially built  <br>

 in the same language and that language is our beloved javascript <br>
