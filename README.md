# Khatami_Node.js

### Introduction

Node js is an environment to run java script outside of the browser .<br>

Node.js was created in 2009 and built on chrome v8 javascript emgine <br>

Every browser has an engine a toll that compiles our code <br>

down to machine code and chrome uses one by the name of v8 <br>

In extremely simple terms the creator of node Ryan dahl <br>
 ripped the v8 engine and build node on top of it <br>

 Since the moment it was created the node has evoved tremendously <br>

 and where there are many things to like about node <br>

 I particularly enjoy large community around node sinec that tremendously save3s time <br>

 on feature development as well as the fact withe help of node it is never been easier <br>

 to build full stack apps since both front end and bacxk end are essentially built  <br>

 in the same language and that language is our beloved javascript <br>

while working with node js we have no access to browser apis , since well they don't simply <br>
\
exits in node , there is no browser , there is no DOM ( Document Object Model)  <br>

Document Object Model is a representation of the elements and data within a web document.<br>
It encompasses the structure and content of the document on the web. The Document Object Model (DOM) serves as a programming interface designed for web documents
 
there is no geo location, no fetch and all the other cool browser goodies   <br>
